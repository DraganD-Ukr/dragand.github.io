</p2>

<header>
  <h2>1. OMEN</h2> 
</header>



<p2>
Omen is a highly rated tech company that began very small and was known as Voodoo PC before being acquired by HP. 
Voodoo PC was founded in Calgary, Canada, and produced luxury PCs and gaming systems.

HP acquired the Voodoo brand in 2006 and continued to use the name for their gaming division until 2013. 
Since then, the company has been renamed Omen, but the original logo remains.

HP is known for producing high-quality computer products. 
The Omen division uses resources and technology to create some of the greatest gaming PCs available.

Omen now includes mice, headsets, and keyboards in the company's characteristic black with red accents color scheme. 
Its current top-of-the-line PC, the Omen Obelisk, has outstanding performance.

This is the best brand to get the best gaming PC on a budget, no matter where you are in the world, and it perfectly answers the question: 
what are the best gaming PC brands?
</p2>

<header>
  <h2>2. ALIENWARE</h2>
</header>



<p2>
Alienware began as Sakai in 1996 before changing its name to Alienware in 1997. 
Nelson Gonzalez, the company's founder, began by upgrading his friends' computers for gaming 
because regular PCs at the time were inadequate.

Soon after, the company focused solely on gaming PCs, and its reputation flourished. 
The Alienware Blade, which earned the PC gamer editor's choice award, put the company on the map.

Dell acquired Alienware in 2006, and the company has since continued to produce high-quality gaming hardware. 
The company is known for pushing the limits of what a gaming computer can be.

Many of its designs are unique to the market, but the quality is always excellent. 
Alienware is still at the top of its game for gaming PCs, as evidenced by the new Aurora R11 Gaming Desktop.

This is undoubtedly one of the best gaming PC brands. But it comes second after Omen due to their higher prices.
</p2>

<header>
  <h2>3. CORSAIR</h2>
</header>


<p2>In the year 1994, Corsair was founded in the state of California. 
Cache and DRAM modules were among the first computer components it produced.

The company grew from humble beginnings to produce additional computer components before producing its own branded PCs. 
Corsair has continued to expand over time, acquiring companies such as Scuf Gaming, Origin Computers, and Elgato along the way.

Corsair's ecosystem has grown to include everything from headsets and keyboards to cases and gaming PCs. 
Corsair products may all be linked via the ICUE software, one of the biggest reasons to utilize them.

The software provides real-time status for all of your components, allowing you to sync them to function better together 
and have matching RGB lighting colors. The Corsair Vengeance i7200 is the company's latest gaming PC 
that performs like a full-time gaming machine.

Although the Corsair Vengeance i7200 is not as expensive as some of its competitors, it still provides access to some 
of the most powerful hardware available.

Because the Vengeance i7200 comes in a plain-looking casing with no peripherals, this is the case. 
However, if you value substance over style, this is the gaming PC for you.

You can build a beast of a machine with CPUs up to an Intel Core i9-10850K and GPUs up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 
if you can afford it.
</p2>



<header>
  <h2>4. REPUBLIC OF GAMERS (ROG)</h2>
</header>



<p2>
Does this brand ring a bell to you? We're pretty sure it doesn't. 
This is because the Republic of Gamers (ROG) is the gaming division of the tech giants, Asus.

ROG is a unique brand among the top 10 gaming PC brands. 
For example, Omen and Alienware rely on third-party manufacturers for some of their components.

However, the ROG brand primarily makes use of in-house components to create excellent gaming hardware. 
If you don't want to buy a prebuilt PC, you can create a bespoke rig utilizing only Asus ROG components. 
ROG's latest gaming masterpiece is the Huracan G21CX.

With just one tryout, you'll see that the ROG Huracan is unlike any other gaming desktop. 
Its asymmetrically designed chassis features a folding magnetic side cover that enhances airflow into the system 
and allows for a CPU and GPU performance boost when opened.

The additional airflow offers the necessary cooling to unleash the full power of its 8th Generation Intel® Core TM i7 processor 
and NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1080 graphics for incredible gaming experiences – allowing you to play the latest games at their most intense settings.

This makes this brand one of the best gaming PC brands for getting the best gaming PC custom build.
</p2>

<header>
  <h2>5. PREDATOR</h2>
</header>



<p2>
Predator is a division of Acer that specializes in gaming hardware. 
Acer, which was formed in 1976, is a Taiwanese firm. 
It began by manufacturing components before transitioning to IBM PC compatible systems in the 1980s.

Since then, it has expanded to become one of the world's foremost providers of PCs, laptops, and monitors.

With the release of the Acer Aspire Predator Desktop PCs in 2008, the Predator brand was born. 
Laptops, monitors, and other accessories have all been added to the line. 
The Predator line's goods are of the greatest quality, and the predator Helios 700 is the most recent addition.

The Predator Helios 700 features a sharply slanted chassis and an all-black color scheme, typical of Acer's Predator line. 
Its bold keyboard typeface and futuristic-looking power button are all part of the DNA. 
It's a look you have to enjoy if you want to buy a notebook like this one.

We applaud Acer for being prepared to go further than many other brands to bring one of the best gaming PC deals in the market.
</p2>

<header>
  <h2>6. ORIGIN PC</h2>
</header>



<p2>
Origin PC is currently a Corsair subsidiary. 
However, we've kept it on the list since it provides a distinct service from its parent company. 
Origin PC was founded in 2009 by former Alienware employees who wished to return to custom PC development.

Corsair purchased the company in 2019 after it had grown at an exponential rate. 
Every device created by Origin PC is designed to your exact specs and requirements, 
which sets it apart from the other brands on this list and made it part of our good gaming PC brands recommended.

Rather than spending hours assembling a one-of-a-kind rig, you can hire Origin PC to do it for you. 
Everything about the case, from the color to the material used for the panels, can be customized.

You should expect to pay more for an Origin PC build than you would for a conventional prebuilt PC, 
but it's well worth it for a one-of-a-kind machine.
</p2>

<header>
  <h2>7. MSI</h2>
</header>



<p2>
Micro-Star International (MSI) was founded in Taiwan in 1986. 
It's another firm that began by manufacturing motherboards and add-on cards. 
The company's expansion has been powered by its goods, which have all performed admirably.

In 2004, it debuted its first notebook computer, and in 2009, it delivered its first all-in-one computer. 
MSI is well-known for its involvement in eSports, having started its gaming line by supporting FNATIC in 2008.

MSI manufactures a wide range of products, including motherboards, graphics cards, and gaming cases. 
The company's gaming line includes laptops and desktops with various performance levels.

You can choose between a budget-friendly Bravo Series laptop and a high-end Titan Series laptop. 
The Aegis Ti5 is the company's top-of-the-line gaming computer.

MEG Aegis Ti5 features a 10th generation Intel® Core TM i9 processor with 10 cores, 20 threads, and a clock speed of up to 5.3GHz.

MEG Aegis Ti5 can generate high frame rates for your games even under intense multitasking workloads. 
Its qualifying functions rightly place the MSI brand as one of the best gaming computer brands.
</p2>

<header>
  <h2>8. INTEL</h2>
</header>



<p2>
Intel's technology has been at the center of computing innovations since its founding in 1968. 
They are a market leader, developing game-changing technology that promotes global progress and improves people's lives.

Artificial intelligence (AI), the 5G network revolution, and the advent of the intelligent edge are all technical inflection points 
that will impact the future of technology. These are driven by silicon and software, and Intel is at the center of it all.

Intel is well known for producing office or work computers, but what if we tell you that Intel has started setting off their gaming PCs 
which are also beginner-friendly. The IBUYPOWER element MR 9320 is an example of this hypothesis.

The IBUYPOWER Element MR 9320 is one of the best prebuilt gaming PC on Amazon, 
which puts intel as one of the best prebuilt gaming PC brands around.

The IBUYPOWER Element MR 9320 features a 10th-generation Intel Core i7-10700F processor, 
Nvidia GTX 1660 TI (6GB) graphics card, 16GB DDR4 RAM, a 240GB SSD, and a 1TB hard drive 
to store all of your games and pretty much everything else.

These are respectable specs these days, and they're more than capable of running recent PC games at 1080p without a hitch.
</p2>
