           Let’s get the obvious one out of the way first. Perhaps you’re new to gaming or you’ve always bought your games offline, 
           at a brick and mortar store, so you don’t know about Steam.

           Steam is the most popular place to buy games. It has a great selection and accepts most currencies. 
           Check reviews carefully at Steam because it’s the most open platform when it comes to allowing developers to add their games to its store. 
           The quality of games on the platform can range from superb to just terrible.

           If you’ve never bought a game on Steam before, check out my How to Play a Game on Steam post.

          The Epic Games store is a relatively new player in the online gaming store area. 
          Apparently it offers developers a better revenue percentage from each sale of their game. 
          However, some gamers don’t like it because they only want to buy their games at one specific store. 
          Epic has managed to land a bunch of exclusives, meaning you can only buy some games at the Epic store. 
          Some Epic exclusives are popular. For example, the last game in The Walking Dead narrative game series is only available at Epic.

          GOG started out as Good Old Games. 
          It specialized in older PC games that might not run any longer on modern PCs unless you wanted to fiddle around with DOSBox, 
          a DOS emulator, or with configuration files. In other words, you couldn’t just buy these older games, install them, and run.
          GOG’s developers received the rights from some older games’ original publishers to make the games easy to run on modern PCs, and then sell them. 
          All sorts of great golden oldies are available at GOG.

          Over time GOG has changed and now it sells all sorts of games. 
          It still sells older games that you can’t find anywhere else, but it also offers modern games, too.

          Origin is Electronic Arts’ gaming platform, but it’s not limited to games published by EA. 
          It has branched out to sell other games, as well, but it still only has a limited selection of games.

          For years, some games have been exclusively available on Origin, such as the Mass Effect and Dragon Age series from BioWare. 
          But recently, EA announced that its games would be returning to Steam.
          That won’t mean the end of Origin though, because it also offers a subscription service called Origin Access, 
          an all-in-one monthly subscription that gives you access to Origin’s entire game library. 
          Of course, if you play a game using your subscription, you don’t actually own it. 
          But if you’re not the type who replays games, you won’t care about that, and you always have the option of buying the games you really enjoyed, 
          either from Origin or another online store.

          UPlay is Ubisoft’s gaming platform. It also has a store where you can buy Ubisoft games. Its selection is quite limited, though. 
          But regardless of where you buy a Ubisoft game, you have to activate it through the UPlay platform.
